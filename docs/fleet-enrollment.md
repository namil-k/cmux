# CMUX fleet machine onboarding

Use this path for CMUX-controlled Mac or Linux hardware that should be eligible for reviewed repository-owned work while existing owners keep their responsibilities.

SSH, MDM/configuration management, the CMUX controller, GitHub Actions, hosted runners, and direct operator access remain separate coordination systems. CMUX defines what a semantic workload means. Glaeda records whether the machine is enrolled for that role and whether a current exact acceptance result exists.

Glaeda tracking: teamleaderleo/glaeda#1056 and #1057.

## Contract boundary

The first reviewed role bindings are:

| Fleet role | CMUX workload profile |
| --- | --- |
| `cmux_macos_native_build` | `cmux.macos.dev-check@1` |
| `cmux_linux_ci` | `cmux.ci.guard@1` |

The profile registry in `scripts/ci/cmux-workload-profiles.json` owns repository entrypoint, semantic validator, expected result class, timeout, resource class, network class, benchmark state classes, runtime inputs, and artifact classes.

Glaeda consumes that profile identity and the canonical `cmux-workload-result/v1` emitted by `scripts/ci/cmux_workload_profile.py`. Glaeda does not maintain another list of CMUX commands or another CMUX pass/fail definition.

Role enrollment is routing-candidate evidence only. Glaeda still performs fresh local admission before execution, and higher-level routing policy still decides whether an eligible node should receive work.

## 1. Prepare the machine

Have exact CMUX and Glaeda checkouts locally. Package installation, accounts, SSH/Tailscale, MDM, power policy, and machine naming stay with the existing operator path.

Common variables:

```bash
GLAEDA_ROOT=/absolute/path/to/glaeda
CMUX_ROOT=/absolute/path/to/cmux
FLEET_ROOT="${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/glaeda/cmux-fleet"
GLAEDA_INSTALL_ROOT="${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}/glaeda/cmux-fleet"
GLAEDA_BIN="$GLAEDA_INSTALL_ROOT/glaeda"
umask 077
install -d -m 700 "$FLEET_ROOT" "$FLEET_ROOT/acceptance" "$GLAEDA_INSTALL_ROOT"

cd "$GLAEDA_ROOT"
./scripts/bootstrap
cargo build --locked --release --bin glaeda
if test -f "$GLAEDA_BIN" && ! test -e "$GLAEDA_INSTALL_ROOT/glaeda.rollback"; then
  cp -p "$GLAEDA_BIN" "$GLAEDA_INSTALL_ROOT/glaeda.rollback"
fi
install -m 755 target/release/glaeda "$GLAEDA_INSTALL_ROOT/.glaeda.next"
mv "$GLAEDA_INSTALL_ROOT/.glaeda.next" "$GLAEDA_BIN"
```

The first candidate install preserves the previously installed Glaeda binary as `glaeda.rollback`. Repeated candidate installs leave that copy untouched until the new enrollment is accepted.

For a Mac native-build node, prepare CMUX's normal build prerequisites and choose the operator-owned cache root:

```bash
CMUX_CACHE_ROOT=/absolute/path/to/cmux-native-cache
(
  cd "$CMUX_ROOT"
  ./scripts/setup.sh
)
export PATH="${CARGO_HOME:-$HOME/.cargo}/bin:/opt/homebrew/bin:/usr/local/bin:$PATH"

bash "$GLAEDA_ROOT/scripts/cmux-fleet-bootstrap-macos" \
  --cmux-root "$CMUX_ROOT" \
  --glaeda "$GLAEDA_BIN" \
  --cache-root "$CMUX_CACHE_ROOT" \
  --hardware-class cmux-mac-build-large \
  --role cmux_macos_native_build \
  > /tmp/cmux-fleet-bootstrap.json
```

For a Linux CI node:

```bash
bash "$GLAEDA_ROOT/scripts/cmux-fleet-bootstrap-linux" \
  --cmux-root "$CMUX_ROOT" \
  --glaeda "$GLAEDA_BIN" \
  --hardware-class cmux-linux-ci-medium \
  --role cmux_linux_ci \
  > /tmp/cmux-fleet-bootstrap.json
```

Bootstrap is read-only. It verifies the exact CMUX checkout exposes the reviewed role profile at generation 1 and that the observed OS/architecture can run it.

## 2. Create the enrollment record

Choose an opaque node ID. Hostnames, serial numbers, private addresses, usernames, and MDM identifiers stay out of the record.

```bash
cd "$GLAEDA_ROOT"
case "$(uname -s)" in
  Darwin) NODE_ID=cmux-mac-001 ;;
  Linux) NODE_ID=cmux-linux-001 ;;
  *) echo "unsupported host" >&2; exit 1 ;;
esac

ENROLLMENT="$FLEET_ROOT/enrollment.json"
ENROLLMENT_NEXT="$(mktemp "$FLEET_ROOT/.enrollment.XXXXXX")"
python3 scripts/cmux_fleet.py enroll /tmp/cmux-fleet-bootstrap.json \
  --node-id "$NODE_ID" \
  --scope cmux-founders \
  --generation 1 \
  > "$ENROLLMENT_NEXT"
chmod 600 "$ENROLLMENT_NEXT"
mv "$ENROLLMENT_NEXT" "$ENROLLMENT"
```

The new enrollment starts in `enrolling`. It records the role's exact CMUX profile ID/generation, the observed toolchain generation, the installed Glaeda generation, and bounded machine capability classes.

## 3. Run the CMUX-owned acceptance profile

The CMUX checkout must represent the exact source being accepted. The workload runner revalidates exact source identity and rejects dirty source, including materialized dirty submodule bytes.

```bash
CMUX_COMMIT="$(git -C "$CMUX_ROOT" rev-parse 'HEAD^{commit}')"
CMUX_TREE="$(git -C "$CMUX_ROOT" rev-parse 'HEAD^{tree}')"
CMUX_RESULT="$(mktemp)"
CMUX_STATE="$(mktemp -d)"

case "$(uname -s)" in
  Darwin) PROFILE=cmux.macos.dev-check ;;
  Linux) PROFILE=cmux.ci.guard ;;
  *) echo "unsupported host" >&2; exit 1 ;;
esac

python3 "$CMUX_ROOT/scripts/ci/cmux_workload_profile.py" run "$PROFILE" \
  --generation 1 \
  --commit "$CMUX_COMMIT" \
  --tree "$CMUX_TREE" \
  --state-class cold \
  --state-root "$CMUX_STATE" \
  --result "$CMUX_RESULT"
```

The canonical result binds exact source, profile generation, semantic validator, runtime-input identities, artifact identities, toolchain identity, benchmark identity, resource summary, process settlement, and terminal result. CMUX owns all of those workload semantics.

## 4. Finalize Glaeda acceptance

```bash
cd "$GLAEDA_ROOT"

case "$(uname -s)" in
  Darwin) ACCEPTANCE_ROLE=cmux_macos_native_build ;;
  Linux) ACCEPTANCE_ROLE=cmux_linux_ci ;;
  *) echo "unsupported host" >&2; exit 1 ;;
esac

TOOLCHAIN_GENERATION="$(python3 -c 'import json,sys; print(json.load(open(sys.argv[1]))["supportedToolchainGenerations"][0])' "$ENROLLMENT")"
ACCEPTANCE="$FLEET_ROOT/acceptance/$ACCEPTANCE_ROLE.json"
ACCEPTANCE_NEXT="$(mktemp "$FLEET_ROOT/acceptance/.$ACCEPTANCE_ROLE.XXXXXX")"

python3 scripts/cmux_fleet.py finalize-acceptance \
  "$ENROLLMENT" "$CMUX_RESULT" \
  --role "$ACCEPTANCE_ROLE" \
  --toolchain-generation "$TOOLCHAIN_GENERATION" \
  > "$ACCEPTANCE_NEXT"
chmod 600 "$ACCEPTANCE_NEXT"
mv "$ACCEPTANCE_NEXT" "$ACCEPTANCE"
```

Glaeda validates the canonical result envelope and its self-consistent comparison/toolchain/cleanup evidence, then records the exact CMUX result digest alongside enrollment generation, role/profile, toolchain generation, Glaeda generation, and process settlement.

A result becomes accepted only when CMUX reports `passed` with complete process settlement.

## 5. Mark the node candidate-eligible

```bash
python3 "$GLAEDA_ROOT/scripts/cmux_fleet.py" transition-apply \
  "$ENROLLMENT" --to eligible \
  --acceptance "$ACCEPTANCE"

bash "$GLAEDA_ROOT/scripts/cmux-fleet" status "$ENROLLMENT" \
  --acceptance "$ACCEPTANCE"
```

`transition-apply` is the durable lifecycle mutation path: one private mutation lock, a fresh current-state read, same-directory staged bytes, fsync, atomic replacement, directory fsync, and published-state revalidation.

Status exposes routing-candidate eligibility while `automaticDispatchAuthorized` remains false. Current host pressure, drain state, physical lease ownership, and higher-level routing policy still apply at execution time.

## 6. Drain, recover, quarantine, or retire

Drain before planned operator work:

```bash
python3 "$GLAEDA_ROOT/scripts/cmux_fleet.py" transition-apply \
  "$ENROLLMENT" --to draining
```

Return to candidate eligibility only with the still-current acceptance:

```bash
python3 "$GLAEDA_ROOT/scripts/cmux_fleet.py" transition-apply \
  "$ENROLLMENT" --to eligible \
  --acceptance "$ACCEPTANCE"
```

Quarantine a concrete mismatch:

```bash
python3 "$GLAEDA_ROOT/scripts/cmux_fleet.py" transition-apply \
  "$ENROLLMENT" --to quarantined --reason toolchain_mismatch
```

Retire a node:

```bash
python3 "$GLAEDA_ROOT/scripts/cmux_fleet.py" transition-apply \
  "$ENROLLMENT" --to retired
```

After an OS, hardware class, toolchain, installed Glaeda, or reviewed role-profile generation change, rerun bootstrap, advance the enrollment generation, and rerun the CMUX profile acceptance.

## Rollback and cleanup

Before a candidate Glaeda generation is accepted:

```bash
test -f "$GLAEDA_INSTALL_ROOT/glaeda.rollback"
mv "$GLAEDA_INSTALL_ROOT/glaeda.rollback" "$GLAEDA_BIN"
```

After successful re-enrollment and role acceptance:

```bash
rm -f "$GLAEDA_INSTALL_ROOT/glaeda.rollback"
rm -f /tmp/cmux-fleet-bootstrap.json "$CMUX_RESULT"
rm -rf "$CMUX_STATE"
```

The canonical enrollment and finalized acceptance receipt stay under `$FLEET_ROOT` across reboot.

## CI and physical proof

Hosted CI validates the CMUX profile contract and Glaeda's enrollment/result-binding contract without claiming physical hardware acceptance.

The first physical proof should use one CMUX-owned host with two caller classes converging on the same machine-local lease boundary. The preferred proof remains a GitHub Actions compile request plus a direct CMUX native request, or the Linux equivalent.
